# break:used to exit the loop
# continue:used to skip the present iteration of the loop
# pass:is a null statement that does nothing.It is used as a placeholder for future code

# it seems that continue also does the same work as pass but continue is skipping every iteration but they are happening whereas pass denotes that there is no code here to be executed so loop doesn't execute
